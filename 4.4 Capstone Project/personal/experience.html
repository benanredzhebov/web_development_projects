    <h1>My Professional Experience</h1>
    <p>
      I have a total of six years of experience in the glass production
      industry, where I worked at a leading European Glass Production Company.
      For the first five years, I served as a Production Planner. During this
      time, I was responsible for overseeing capacity planning, creating and
      maintaining production line schedules, managing packaging requirements,
      and coordinating raw materials between production departments. I also
      prepared monthly activity reports to evaluate performance and ensure
      efficient workflows.
    </p>

    <p>
      After five years, I was promoted to the role of Production Engineer, where
      I played a key role in optimizing production processes by eliminating
      waste, managing resources, and implementing new technologies. I led
      efforts to streamline production by adopting the Just-in-Time strategy,
      which reduced overproduction and minimized downtime. One of my significant
      achievements was successfully managing color campaigns, which helped
      minimize thickness changeovers and reduced forced production. This
      initiative resulted in completing the expected production two days ahead
      of schedule.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to production optimization, I managed inventory and
      coordinated with other departments to solve production challenges. A
      notable project involved resolving surface scratches on thin glass during
      production. My team and I conducted thorough analyses and determined that
      the issue stemmed from robotic handling and a specific section of the
      production line. By working with external experts for geodetic
      measurements and adjusting robotic programming, we successfully resolved
      the issue, ensuring smooth operations moving forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout my time in the glass production industry, I gained valuable
      skills in team management, supply chain coordination, big data analysis,
      and reporting. These experiences helped me drive continuous improvement
      and optimize operations to meet production targets efficiently.
