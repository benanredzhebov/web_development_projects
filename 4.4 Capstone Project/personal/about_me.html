    <h1>A Brief Biography</h1>
    <p>I was born on June 15, 1990, and I am married with two children.</p>
    <p>
      I completed my Bachelor's (2009-2013) and Master's (2013-2014) degrees in
      "Automation, Information, and Control Technology" at "Angel Kanchev"
      University of Ruse.
    </p>
    <p>
      After finishing my education, I embarked on a professional career,
      accumulating over 10 years of experience. In late 2023, I took a
      significant step in my career by joining a programmer school in Germany,
      embarking on an exciting new journey in the tech world.
