<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I bring six years of experience in the glass production industry, having worked at a leading European Glass Production Company.
  My journey began as a Production Planner, where I spent five years honing my skills in organizing work, managing teams, and coordinating
  supply chains. I was then promoted to the role of Production Engineer, where I expanded my expertise in inventory management, production
  planning, and data-driven reporting and analysis. My experience includes successfully managing color campaigns and optimizing production
  processes, which has equipped me to drive continuous improvement in any future role.</p>

<p>Recently, I made the strategic decision to pursue further education in Software Engineering in Germany. This decision was driven by my
  desire to expand my knowledge in a rapidly evolving field and to immerse myself in one of the worldâ€™s most powerful economies. With a keen
  interest in software development, coding languages, and new technologies, I left my position in Bulgaria to embark on this exciting new journey.
  I am confident that my technical background and newly acquired skills will enable me to make significant contributions in the tech industry.</p>
